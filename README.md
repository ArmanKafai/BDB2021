# BDB2021

To start this project, you must download the data from the Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/data.

From there, download the code marked 'Final BDB Code 2021.R'. Plase make sure you save the files to a proper working directory before starting.

There is a table script listed as well. I had issues with my computer being able to handle the code, so I was given the final CSV to help make the tables. The table script in there though produces the images using NFLFastR's team_colors_logos based on the abbreivation and when you have the final code, you can create these tables.
